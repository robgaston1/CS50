1)What's stdint.io?
a header that declares sets of integer types that have a set size

2)What's the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t?
these relate the size of BYTE, WORD, LONG to specific native variables

3)How many bytes is a BYTE, WORD, LONG and WORD? BYTE: 1, DWORD 4, LONG:4, WORD: 2

4)What (ASCII, HEX, or DEC) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
characters (in ascii) "B" and "M"

5)What's the difference between bfsize and bisize?
bisize is the header file size. bfsize is the entire file size

6)What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
means the map is top down and starts in the upper left corner. Otherwise if positive, the map starts in the lower left and is bottom up

7)What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP's color depth(bits per pixel)
bibitcount

8)Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
The input file does not exist or the output file was not included in the command line as arguments

9)Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
it is the number of elements to be read, which is just one element, of byte number "size"

10)What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
1
11) What does fseek do?
skips over padding, by moving the pointer past padding
12)What is seek_cur?
It is the current position of the file pointer
